# Sorting Algorithms

This repository purely serves as a space to store and share sorting algorithm scripts I have written. 

<br />

### Pre-Installation

We will assume [python](https://www.python.org/) is pre installed as well as the package manager pip.

Installing on global vs an environment. It is suggested to install pygame and it's dependencies in an environment rather than in the global scope. 
##### *Using an environment can sidestep future complications when using different versions of packages

<br />

If you choose to initialize globally, skip to installation.

### ENV Pre-Installation
##### *For more help, visit [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
1. Install virtualenv
```python
pip3 install virtualenv
```
<br />

2. Create an environment at the current directory
```python
python3 venv nameYouGive
```

<br />

3. To activate the environme
```
source env/bin/activate
```

<br />

4. If you wish to leave the virtual environment
```
deactivate
```
<br />

### Installation

1. Installing [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

pip3 install pygame=2.0.0.dev6
```
